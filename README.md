## 📖 Usage Guide

### Building Your First Knowledge Graph

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Click "Add PDFs" or drag and drop PDF files onto the Dataset card
   - Supported formats: PDF files only

2. **Run Indexing**
   - Click the "Run Index" button to start the GraphRAG processing
   - Monitor progress in real-time with detailed logs
   - The process extracts entities, relationships, and communities from your documents

3. **Explore the Graph**
   - Once indexing completes, your 3D knowledge graph will appear
   - Use mouse controls to navigate: drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
   - Click on nodes to inspect entities and their connections

### Advanced Usage

#### Community Analysis
- Enable "Community Isolator" to focus on specific community hierarchies
- Communities are organized in levels: Sector → System → Subsystem → Component → Element

#### Search and Discovery
- Use the search box (Cmd/Ctrl + K) to find specific entities
- Matching entities will be highlighted in the visualization
- Use the Inspector panel to view detailed entity information

#### Chat Interface
- Switch to the Chat tab to query your knowledge graph using natural language
- Ask questions like "What are the main themes?" or "How are these entities connected?"

#### Archive Management
- Create archives of your current knowledge graph state
- Restore previous versions to compare different document sets
- Rename archives for better organization

### Data Flow
1. **Document Upload** → PDF processing and text extraction
2. **GraphRAG Processing** → Entity extraction, relationship mapping, community detection
3. **Data Transformation** → JSON format optimization for web rendering
4. **3D Visualization** → Force-directed layout with community clustering
5. **Interactive Querying** → AI-powered search and analysis

## ⚙️ Configuration

### GraphRAG Settings (`settings.yaml`)
The configuration file controls the GraphRAG processing pipeline:

```yaml
models:
  default_chat_model:
    type: openai_chat
    model: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
  
  default_embedding_model:
    type: openai_embedding  
    model: text-embedding-3-small
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}

extract_graph:
  entity_types: [organization, person, geo, event]
  max_gleanings: 1

community_reports:
  max_length: 2000
  max_input_length: 8000
```

### Customization Options

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Graph not loading after indexing**
- Check that all required JSON files are generated in the `output/` directory
- Verify the API endpoints are accessible at `/api/data/`

**Slow 3D performance**  
- Reduce the number of visible communities in complex graphs
- Try disabling bloom effects in crowded visualizations
- Consider filtering to smaller entity subsets

**Indexing fails**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Check that GraphRAG Python package is installed
- Review the indexing logs for specific error messages

**Memory issues with large documents**
- Process documents in smaller batches
- Increase Node.js memory limit: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`
